            <p class="content">
                In the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, most American college students are home from school, often with
                limited
                academic responsibilities and many companies are moving operations online to slow the outbreak's spread.
                Students remaining quarantined in their home can gain valuable experience in industry during this time
                through
                remote internships.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                While remote internships have existed for some time, they're now more popular and needed than ever, when
                multiple states are under "Stay-at-Home" orders and millions of students are home from college.
                COVINTERN
                connects employers with positions and programs to fill with students from top universities with
                avaliable

                and a desire to learn.

                COVINTERN was created by Wade Fletcher, a student at Indiana University.
